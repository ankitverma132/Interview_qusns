/*Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, find the edit distance between the strings.
Edit Distance
Edit Distance of two strings is minimum number of operations required to make one string equal to other.
 In order to do so you can perform any of the following three operations only :
1. Delete a character
2. Replace a character with another one
3. Insert a character*/
/*Sample Input 1 :
abc
dc
Sample Output 1 :
2*/

/*Input:   str1 = “sunday”, str2 = “saturday”
Output:  3
Explanation: Last three and first characters are same.  We basically need to convert “un” to “atur”. 
This can be done using below three operations. Replace ‘n’ with ‘r’, insert t, insert a*/
